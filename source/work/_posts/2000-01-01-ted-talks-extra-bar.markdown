description: '<p>The objective was to visually present this “extras” bar in a way
that would draw a user to click it while on a talk page. The
content it links to is curated by the speaker.</p>

<p>The “extras” bar needed to make apparent that the
information it links to is directly related to the talk and not
external. It also had to flow smoothly on the page in order
for users to know there was more information beneath it.
Lastly, the bar had to be designed in a way that if only one
button were to show, it would still function visually on all
screen sizes.</p>'
