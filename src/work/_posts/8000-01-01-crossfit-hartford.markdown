description: '<p>CrossFit Hartford is a nontraditional gym that features mixed
martial arts. I was tasked with designing a logo that would
represent their sense of D-I-Y strength and fighting spirit.
They requested to include barbell imagery along with using
their original color scheme of orange and black.</p>
<p>
Upon further research, “CrossFit” was the more general
branding of the athletic program while each city’s name was
the distinguishing aspect. The logo thus focuses on the three
letters, “C,” “F,” and “H,” with the most valuable of the three
letters integrated into the barbell. The “H” also has a skewed
bar to indicate a sense of rugged, nontraditional values.</p>'
